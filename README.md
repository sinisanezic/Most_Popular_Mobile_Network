During the second semester of my Post-degree studies at Langara College, as part of the Business Statistics class, 
I successfully completed a project with the main objective of determining the most popular mobile network among Langara students.

The project involved collecting data from primary sources, specifically through surveys and interviews. 
The data collected was then analyzed using various statistical methods, including the Four Steps of Hypothesis Testing, 
Chi-Square Test, Correlation Coefficient, Estimation of Regression Equation, and Tukey's Five-Number Summary.

To effectively visualize the data, we utilized a range of data visualization techniques such as bar charts, pie charts, 
scatter diagrams, and histograms.

By employing these rigorous analytical techniques and visualizations, the project aimed to provide a comprehensive 
and professional analysis of the popularity of mobile networks among Langara students.
